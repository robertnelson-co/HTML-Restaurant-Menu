        <p>H-Thai-ML is a Thai restaurant based out of Cape Town, South Africa, that was founded by a man named Preecha. Preecha had a difficult past and had spent several years in prison for a crime he did not commit. While he was incarcerated, he had a lot of time to reflect on his life and his identity as a Thai person living in South Africa. He realized that he had lost touch with his cultural heritage and decided that once he was released, he would do everything he could to reconnect with his roots.<br>
            <br>
            Upon his release, Preecha began to explore his Thai identity in earnest. He immersed himself in the language, music, and art of Thailand, and started cooking Thai food for himself and his friends. His food was so delicious that word began to spread, and soon people were asking him to cater events and even open a restaurant.<br>
<br>
            Preecha saw this as an opportunity to not only share his love of Thai food with others but also to create a business that could support him and his family. He spent months planning and preparing, and finally, in 2018, he opened H-Thai-ML in the heart of Cape Town.<br>
            <br>
            The restaurant quickly became a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. Preecha's food was authentic and flavorful, and he made a point to create a welcoming atmosphere that reflected the warmth and hospitality of Thai culture. His staff, many of whom were also Thai, were like family to him, and he was proud to be able to provide them with a stable job and a supportive workplace.<br>
            <br>
            Today, H-Thai-ML is a thriving business that continues to grow and expand. Preecha has become a respected member of the Cape Town community, and he takes pride in knowing that he is helping to introduce people to the beauty and richness of Thai culture. Despite the challenges he faced in his past, Preecha has found a way to turn his life around and create something truly special.</p>
